            <h1>What is Diaryx?</h1>
            <p>
                The word &quot;Diaryx&quot; is like 'diary' plus the letter 'x'!
                Like a futuristic version of a diary. (It is pronounced just
                like it looks: &quot;diary - x.&quot;)
            </p>
            <p>
                Diaryx is a project that seeks to spread awareness of the power
                of writing to change hearts and minds for the better. To do
                this, it provides:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the Diaryx Writing Specification, a useful and open writing
                    standard,
                </li>
                <li>the Diaryx application, which uses the specification,</li>
                <li>
                    and an upcoming persistent identifier (PID) system to make
                    permanence accessible.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                There was a time in history when the ability to read and write
                was rare and valued. Eventually, nearly everyone learned how to
                read and write, which led to a revolution— primarily in the way
                people could think and how they could express themselves. Then,
                like clockwork, followed advancements in the sciences and the
                arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that in mind, consider the following statements of belief:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em
                        >We believe that the ability to read and write were key
                        to all of the technological advancements that we benefit
                        from today.</em
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em
                        >We believe that one of the most powerful ways to
                        benefit humanity today is to increase their
                        literacy.</em
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em
                        >We believe that personal writing is important for three
                        reasons: first, metacognition; second, structure; and
                        third, consistency.</em
                    >
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Metacognition</strong> is the ability to think about
                your own thoughts. You can look inside yourself and see what is
                actually going on in there! Writing in a diary or journal makes
                this easier by helping you see your thoughts outside yourself—
                on paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Structure</strong> is the antidote to unhelpful
                thinking. When we observe our own thoughts, we may see things we
                don't like. Writing helps us introduce structure into our mind
                by putting our thoughts through a filter, and into physical,
                seeable text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Consistency</strong> helps you keep the good in and the
                bad out. You may change from day to day, but your writing
                doesn't change unless you choose to change it. Therefore,
                writing can be like a ship's anchor— when the storms of life
                come, you have the option to read what you have written and stay
                strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em
                    >Diaryx is designed to help you in these three ways:
                    metacognition, structure, and consistency.</em
                >
            </p>
            <h2>How does it do that?</h2>
            <p>
                Right now, Diaryx is in its infancy. Neither the writing
                specification nor the Diaryx software are ready for widespread
                use. It boils down to a Tauri-based markdown editor and a
                loosely-defined YAML frontmatter schema. But I have big dreams!
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, the Diaryx specification is probably most useful for
                power users of the
                <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> app. (Click
                <a href="Diaryx-Obsidian%20Workflow.md">here</a> to see how!)
                But eventually it will be the universal format for all personal
                writing, and perhaps even more forms of self-quantifying.
