# Diaryx Site

This is the repository for the Diaryx website. The content is contained primarily in `src/content/diaryx`; everything else is essentially styling and tooling to make the markdown and images work well with the web.

We're proud to use [Astro](https://astro.build/), because it makes markdown->web conversion super easy.

## Contribute

We are looking for people to contribute to the Diaryx effort! See the [contribute page](./src/content/diaryx/contribute.md) for more information.
