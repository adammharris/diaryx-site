            <h1>Diaryx Writing Specification</h1>
            <p>
                The Diaryx Writing Format is a specific way of writing a digital
                document that makes the writing process easier and more
                effective. It is meant to be both human-readable and
                machine-parseable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of writing is to connect the reader with the author.
                The Diaryx Writing Format is unique in that it places this
                purpose front and center. Each Diaryx document requires the
                author to specify the following properties:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>title</code>: a short summary of the document</li>
                <li>
                    <code>author</code>: the identity of the writer(s) of the
                    document
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>created</code>: the time the document was first
                    created
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>updated</code>: the time the document was last updated
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>visibility</code>: the identity of the
                    audience/reader(s) of the document
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>format</code>: the format of the text body (for
                    example, CommonMark)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>reachable</code>: where this writing is accessible
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Requiring explicit definitions for these values makes writing
                easier and more productive for the author:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Authors plan their writing more effectively when they are
                    required to specify what they are writing about (title) and
                    who they are writing to (visibility).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authors find it easier to write when they constantly have
                    the purpose of their writing in view— less writer's block
                    and more writing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authors and coauthors find it easier to review writing when
                    they can quickly grasp the context of the writing, without
                    trying to search for it in the body of the text.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It also makes writing easier to understand and more impactful
                for the reader:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Readers find it easier to know whether to read or not when
                    the purpose and context of the writing is immediately clear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Readers find it easier to understand the writing as they
                    read because the purpose of the writing is constantly
                    visible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Readers find it easier to revisit and share the content
                    afterward, because it is very clear what the content is and
                    where and to whom it is accessible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The way Diaryx accomplishes this is simple and compatible with
                widely-accepted standards: a Diaryx file is simply a Markdown
                file with YAML frontmatter. Markdown is a widely used markup
                format, and YAML frontmatter is a common standard for Markdown
                files, widely recognized in tools such as Pandoc and GitHub. So,
                the Diaryx Writing Format is perhaps best understood as a YAML
                frontmatter schema and a collection of best practices.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is this standard needed?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong
                        >Digital writing has no single portable format.</strong
                    >
                    Note-taking apps in particular are notorious for locking
                    users into their ecosystem. Even when a popular format such
                    as Markdown is used, there’s no agreement on how to
                    represent important metadata such as dates, relation to
                    other writings, or sharing permissions. As a result,
                    personal writings — often a person’s most important and
                    private records — risk being lost over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong
                        >Most things people write are not intended to be
                        public.</strong
                    >
                    In contrast, existing standardized writing formats are
                    public-facing (essays, posts, microblogs, comments). HTML,
                    APA, and MLA are all designed for public-facing or academic
                    work. Non-public or private writing deserves the same
                    long-term portability as published works.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong
                        >Recent technological advances are forcing the world to
                        reconsider what makes writing meaningful.</strong
                    >
                    Most famously, applications for interfacing with large
                    language models, such as ChatGPT, have shocked many people
                    into wondering if essays are
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The Diaryx Writing Format aims to fill these gaps by
                <strong
                    >standardizing good, readable metadata practices.</strong
                >
                This helps Diaryx files be super portable and shareable, helps
                writers keep in mind why they are writing, and helps readers
                make more informed decisions about what they read.
            </p>
            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <p>
                Principles are guidelines for how this specification should be.
                Here are some guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Human-readable</strong>: Diaryx metadata should make
                    intuitive sense to a non-technical person reading the plain
                    text file. For example, we avoid JSON and prefer YAML. And
                    by default, a file's format is CommonMark, a well-defined
                    markup syntax designed to be both readable in plain text and
                    publishable as-is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-describing</strong>: A Diaryx file should
                    describe itself sufficiently well to introduce a newcomer.
                    For example, the required properties answer the basic
                    newcomer questions of &quot;What is this?&quot; (title)
                    &quot;Who wrote it?&quot; (author) &quot;When was it
                    written?&quot; (created, updated) &quot;Who can see
                    it?&quot; (visibility) and &quot;How do I understand
                    it?&quot; (format). Additional optional properties allow
                    authors to provide more context when needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Author flexibility</strong>: Should limit the author
                    as little as possible— not requiring them to name or
                    organize their files in a specific way where reasonable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minimal metadata</strong>: A Diaryx file should
                    describe itself as concisely as possible. It should follow
                    well-established conventions and use the absolute minimum
                    amount of metadata possible, while still being sufficiently
                    self-describing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you open a file or folder without any prior context.
                What would you search for? How would you understand the content
                of the file?
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most intuitive introduction is a plain description
                in your native language, like &quot;This file is a journal entry
                recorded on Dec 31, 2003 by John Doe.&quot; However, this
                presupposes several things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the reader is familiar with how this entry relates to other
                    entries
                </li>
                <li>
                    the reader knows what format John Doe usually writes his
                    entries in
                </li>
                <li>
                    the reader knows John Doe is okay with sharing this entry
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If the file was in Diaryx format, the reader would see something
                like this:
            </p>

            <p>
                Now the reader knows that this entry is appropriate to share
                with family, and that John Doe recorded this particular entry in
                CommonMark format. We also see that this entry is part of a
                larger group of entries, as is evident in the

            <h1>YAML Frontmatter</h1>
            <p>
                YAML frontmatter is a common convention for human-readable
                metadata. Diaryx adopts this convention and requires six
                properties, and allows for additional properties.

                    writing is intended for, such as <code>private</code> or
                    <code>public</code>. Can be any single string or list of
                    strings. If this value is a list, the list should not
                    include the values &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot;
                    in order to avoid confusion.

                    document's content. By default, is the latest CommonMark
                    spec. Can also be a list to allow for a certain format with
                    extensions (for example, CommonMark with table, footnote,

                    the document. The purpose of this property is to give a
                    reader a way to share the document without copying and
                    sending the entire document. So it should either be a
                    reliable reference, or if the document is not public,
                    perhaps contact information for the author of the document.

                        >&quot;[alias](link)&quot;</code
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    Items should be listed in intended reading/processing order
                </li>
                <li>
                    File paths are relative to the document containing this
                    frontmatter
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that markdown links must be URL-encoded. To avoid this,
                    the CommonMark spec allows links to be wrapped in angle
                    brackets so you can write the name of the link without URL
                    encoding (for example,
                    <code>[GoCoEdit Files](&lt;GoCoEdit Files.md&gt;)</code> as
                    opposed to
                    <code>[GoCoEdit Files](GoCoEdit%20Files.md)</code>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure to include file extensions in the link for
                    compatibility.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><code>part_of</code></h3>
            <p>
                Specifies parent index files that contain/organize this
                document. Only used by content files.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-yaml"># Single parent
part_of: &quot;[](&lt;GoCoEdit files.md&gt;)&quot;

# Multiple parents
part_of:
  - &quot;[](&lt;GoCoEdit files.md&gt;)&quot;
  - &quot;[](&lt;Creative Writing.md&gt;)&quot;
</code></pre>
            <h3><code>version</code></h3>
            <p>
                A version number for the document, in case you want to record
                formal version updates. This specification has an example at the
                top.
            </p>
            <h3><code>copying</code></h3>
            <p>
                Used for showing users the ways they are allowed to copy the
                document. Can be a file path to a license file, or a link to a
                popular license, such as
                <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
                    >https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a
                >. This specification has an example at the top.
            </p>
            <h3><code>checksums</code></h3>
            <p>File path to checksums. Useful for verifying file downloads.</p>
            <h3><code>banner</code></h3>
            <p>
                Used for specifying an optional Notion-style image banner over a
                file. Link to image, or alternatively use
                <code>!(alias)[&lt;link&gt;]</code> syntax.
            </p>
            <h3><code>language</code></h3>
            <p>Used for specifying the language this file is written in.</p>
            <h3><code>tags</code>, <code>aliases</code></h3>
            <p>
                Both of these are lists of arbitrary strings.
                <code>tags</code> is used for assigning topics or organization
                groups to entries. <code>aliases</code> is used to specify other
                names this entry could go by.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-yaml">tags: [&quot;notes&quot;,&quot;thoughts&quot;] #any string you want, as many as you want
aliases: [&quot;That one note&quot;, &quot;my favorite note&quot;]
</code></pre>
            <h3>Flags</h3>
            <p>
                These property values give information simply by their presence.
                Their value is always <code>true</code>; otherwise they are
                invalid. (That is, a <code>false</code> value would be the flag
                simply not being present.)
            </p>
            <h4><code>this_file_is_root_index</code></h4>
            <p>
                Flag indicating whether this file serves as the root index for a
                collection. If a file uses this property, it must also use the
                <code>contents</code> property. If present, must be
                <code>true</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-yaml">this_file_is_root_index: true   # This is the main organizational hub

            <p>
                Flag indicating that this file has been designated by the author
                to be part of a special first-class group of documents. If
                present, must be <code>true</code>.
            </p>
            <h4><code>pinned</code></h4>
            <p>
                Flag indicating that this file has been designated as requiring

            <h2>Error Handling</h2>
            <p>
                If the YAML frontmatter is malformed, it may not be parsed and
                the Diaryx-formatted file is invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the YAML is valid but does not adhere to rules in the
                specification (for example, an invalid range or unit), that
                specific property is invalid, but the Diaryx formatted file is
                otherwise valid. If any of the required properties are invalid,
                the whole Diaryx file is invalid.
            </p>
