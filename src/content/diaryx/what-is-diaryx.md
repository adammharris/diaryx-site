# What is Diaryx?

Diaryx is a _writing format_ and a set of tools built around it.

At the top of each entry, you write something like this:

```
title: Your entry
author: Your name
audience:
  - Your friends
  - Your family
```

The idea is simple: tell the document its name, its author, and its intended audience. You don't need any special tools to do this. In fact, it is good practice, similar to addressing an envelope before you write it. It helps prevent writer's block by giving you clarity about what you are writing and why.

These important bits of information— title, author, audience, and others— are called **properties**. Diaryx seeks to standardize these and many other properties into a single format.

## What we're building

Diaryx is more than just a format. We're building **tools that turn your labels into reality.**

What if, when you write "audience: family" at the top of your document, the app actually made sure that your family got to read what you wrote? And you could add other labels: "friends," "coworkers," "church group," "class of '08", or whatever else, and the app could share it with all of them?

This is called _role-based access control_ (RBAC). It's technically possible, but no tool like that for personal writing exists yet. The closest alternative is managing a list of emails while praying your platform doesn't shut down or lock you in.

The idea is that you declare what you want your writing to be, and the software make it happen. RBAC is only one application.

## Where we addressing
