# Contribute to Diaryx

Thank you for reading about Diaryx! This project is in early stages. Here are some things we are working on:

- Note-taking apps for every platform
- A declarative writing format designed to extend the significance and longevity of personal writings.
- ARK PID scaffolding

Please email us at [contact@diaryx.org](mailto:contact@diaryx.org) if you can offer help or feedback of any kind.
